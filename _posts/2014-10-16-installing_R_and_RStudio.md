The "Ecological Data Management and Analysis" Course will be very practical and interactive. We will thus learn to use [R](http://www.r-project.org), probably the most extensively used statistical language worldwide.  We will also use [RStudio Desktop](http://www.rstudio.com), a very powerful and user-friendly interface to the R environment. Both programs are open-source and you can thus download, install and use them freely. They are also available for all the most commonly used operating systems (Windows, Mac OS or Linux). 
  
If you will follow the course using your own computer, please make sure to install the latest versions of R (version 3.1.1, codename: "Sock it to Me") and RStudio Desktop (version 0.98.1074). If you are wondering about the R version codename, consider that they are always a bit mysterious (previous versions were called "Spring Dance", and before that "Frisbee Sailing")!  

To make sure that everything works smoothly, you should *first install R, and then RStudio* (and not the other way round).

Hereafter I will provide the necessary steps to install R on a Windows machine (but on the other operative systems it is equally easy):

1. Point to the following website: <http://cran.rstudio.com/>
2. Under "Download and Install R", choose your operative system (Linux, Mac OS or Windows)
3. If you are on Windows, choose the "base" version
4. Click on "Download R 3.1.1 for Windows". The download will start authomatically. 
5. When the download is finished, double-click on the "R-3.1.1-win.exe" file   
6. n installation window will open. Follow all the suggestions and instructions, always replying "OK".
7. You are done! It was that easy! ;)

After having installed R, install RStudio Desktop, which you can download it from here: <http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>  

Again choose your operative system in the list under "Installers for ALL Platforms".
The rest of the installation is very similar to what described above for R. however, if something is unclear or does not work, please feel free to drop me a line via email!
