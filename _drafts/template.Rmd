**Introduction**

Here you describe what the topic and question of your report is (What the heck dov you want to find out and why?)

If I want to cite some other paper I do like this (von Hardenberg 2014) 

**Data**

You describe your data and from where it comes from (provide source!)

**Analysis**

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

**Discussion**


**Literature cited**

von Hardenberg, A. 2014 Title of paper. Journal vol 1, 23-25

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
